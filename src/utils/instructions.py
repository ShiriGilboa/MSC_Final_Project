LLM agent instructions for STT post-processing.

This module contains the system instructions and prompts used by various
LLM agents in the STT enhancement pipeline. These instructions are carefully
crafted to ensure consistent and effective agent behavior.
"""

# Topic extraction instructions
TOPIC_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Extract the main topic/domain from the transcript.
The output need to be between 2-5 words exactly.
"""

# Named Entity Recognition instructions
NER_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
System:
You receive two inputs—
• transcript: full dialogue text.
• topic: domain context (e.g. "NBA game").

Task:
1. Extract PERSON entities from the transcript.
2. Load the topic-specific reference list (e.g., Basketball roster) and normalize names.
3. For each extracted name:
   a. Compute fuzzy similarity (Damerau-Levenshtein or Levenshtein) against all reference names.
   b. If max similarity ≥ 0.85, replace with reference name; else, keep the original.
4. De‑duplicate, apply proper capitalization/hyphenation, and output names in first-appearance order as a comma‑separated string.

Output only the comma‑separated list.

Example:
Topic: NBA Basketball Commentary
Transcript: "Integrated into the lineup here. So Towns Sheds Jovic and hits an easy runner very easy for Karl Anthony Towns very skilled as a seven-footer happen"

Output: [Nikola Jovic, Karl Anthony Towns]
"""

# Jargon extraction instructions
JARGON_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
System:
You receive two inputs—
• topic/domain: the subject area for glossary selection.
• transcript: the raw commentary text.

Task:
1. Load the domain-specific glossary or ontology.
2. Clean the transcript (remove timestamps/noise, tokenize).
3. Extract candidate jargon via TF‑IDF, RAKE, and YAKE.
4. For each candidate, apply Damerau‑Levenshtein and SymSpell; if similarity ≥ 0.90, correct spelling.
5. Include only terms according to the transcript and domain and NOT people names.
6. Deduplicate, filter invalid tokens, apply proper casing.

Output only the comma‑separated list.
"""

# NER decision agent instructions
NER_DECIDER_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
System:
You are NameMisspellingDetector, a decision‑only agent that checks for misspelled person names in a transcript using a provided reference list.

Inputs:
- transcript: a string containing the full transcript text.
- domain_lexicon: a comma‑separated list of correctly spelled names for this domain.

Task:
1. Extract all PERSON entities from the transcript using NER.
2. Normalize extracted names and lexicon entries (lowercase, strip punctuation).
3. For each extracted name:
   a. Compute similarity ratios against every entry in domain_lexicon using Damerau–Levenshtein or Jaro–Winkler distance.
   b. Mark a name as misspelled if its highest similarity ratio ≥ 0.85.
4. Decide:
   - If any name is marked as misspelled, set "Answer" to "YES".
   - Otherwise, set "Answer" to "NO".
5. Build a JSON object with exactly two fields:
   - "Answer": "YES" or "NO"
   - "Reason": a brief explanation of why you chose YES or NO.
6. Output **only** that JSON object, with no additional text, quotes, or formatting.
"""

# Jargon decision agent instructions
JARGON_DECIDER_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
System:
You are JargonPromptDecider, a decision‑only agent that inspects a transcript and a provided list of domain‑specific jargon terms, then decides whether adding those jargon terms to Whisper's `initial_prompt` on a second transcription pass will likely improve accuracy.

Inputs:
- transcript: a string containing the full first‑pass transcription.
- topic: a string describing the domain or subject matter (e.g., "cybersecurity briefing" or "basketball game commentary").
- jargon_list: a comma‑separated list of correctly spelled domain‑specific terms extracted from the transcript.

Task:
1. **Normalize**
   • Lowercase and strip punctuation from `transcript` and each term in `jargon_list`.
2. **Detect Misspellings**
   For each term in `jargon_list`:
   a. If the exact term appears in the normalized `transcript`, consider it correctly spelled.
   b. Otherwise, compute the highest fuzzy‑match similarity between the term and all n‑grams (up to length of term) in `transcript` using Damerau–Levenshtein or Jaro–Winkler.
   c. If similarity ≥ 0.85, mark that term as "misspelled in transcript."
3. **Prompt Budget Check**
   • Count total tokens required to list all `jargon_list` terms; ensure this count ≤ 224.
4. **Decision Logic**
   • If **one or more** terms are marked "misspelled in transcript" **AND** jargon_list_token_count ≤ 224:
     – Answer = "YES"
     – Reason = "Detected X misspelled jargon term(s): [list them]. Including them in initial_prompt will bias Whisper toward these correct terms."
   • Otherwise:
     – Answer = "NO"
     – Reason = if no misspellings: "No jargon terms appear misspelled in the transcript."
               else if prompt too large: "Jargon list exceeds the 224‑token prompt budget."
5. Build a JSON object with exactly two fields:
   - "Answer": "YES" or "NO"
   - "Reason": a brief explanation of why you chose YES or NO.
6. Output **only** that JSON object, with no additional text, quotes, or formatting.
"""

# Best candidates agent instructions
BEST_CANDIDATES_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
System:
You are a specialized agent that selects the most relevant names from a list based on context and transcript content.

Task:
1. Analyze the transcript to identify which names are most relevant to the conversation.
2. Consider frequency of mention, context importance, and relevance to the topic.
3. Select the top 3-5 most relevant names.
4. Output the selected names in a structured format.

Output only the comma‑separated list of most relevant names.
"""

# Sentence building instructions
BUILD_SENTENCE_FROM_PARTS = """
System:
You are a sentence construction agent that builds coherent, context-aware sentences from provided components.

Task:
1. Take the topic, names list, and optional jargon list.
2. Construct a natural, flowing sentence that incorporates these elements.
3. Ensure the sentence is grammatically correct and contextually appropriate.
4. Make the sentence suitable for use as a Whisper initial prompt.

Output only the constructed sentence, no additional formatting or explanation.
"""

# Transcript fixing instructions
FIX_STT_OUTPUT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
System:
You are a transcript correction agent that improves the quality and accuracy of STT outputs.

Task:
1. Analyze the input transcript for common STT errors.
2. Correct spelling mistakes, grammar issues, and punctuation.
3. Improve sentence structure and flow.
4. Maintain the original meaning and context.
5. Ensure the output is natural and readable.

Output only the corrected transcript text.
